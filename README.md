# React github test project

## Goal

Create a small react project using github API with the follow requirements:

- Search by name using github api and list repositories.
- Search username repositories and list them.
- Bookmark repositories.
- Page to list bookmarked repositories
- Search bookmarked repositories

## UX/UI

Suggested to have at least two pages and one searchbar, everything else is up to you.

## Solution

When finished, please create your own branch in github and push to that branch only,
when done create a Pull Request with `your_branch` -> `master` and request a review from myself `daylonball`.

## Bonus

- use ES6 sintax (arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, etc)
- some Unit Test
- Use some state managers
- Having a nice UI
- Using common tools for your daily development environment (linterns, code formatting, etc)

## Recomended libraries

- tailwind css
- redux or recoil
- styled components
- prettier

## Comments

- do `npm i` in bash to install deps and `npm run start` to run the project
